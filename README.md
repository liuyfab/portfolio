# Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

My professional portfolio including a brief summary of my education and skills, two projects including Run Buddy and the Horiseon, and my contat information.

# Requirements in my mind

I used what I have learned in the first two weeks of the bootcamp to write the HTML and CSS from scratch, while keeping in mind the following requirements:

1) Site is divided into several sections, including About Me, My Work, and Contact Info.
2) Functioning navigation links at the top of the page to take the user to any of the sections
3) A link to a PDF of my resume.
4) The non-placholder projects will take the user to the deployed application on my GitHub when clicked on.
5) The page was styled for multiple screen sizes.
6) included some on hover effects for the various links and the projects on the page.
